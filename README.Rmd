`nisrarr` is a package for accessing data from the [NISRA data portal](https://data.nisra.gov.uk) directly from R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of nisrarr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("MarkPaulin/nisrarr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(nisrarr)
head(nisra_search(keyword = "claimant"))
```

``` r
head(nisra_load_dataset("CCMLGD"))
```

## Help wanted / things that need done

There is no error handling at the moment. If you're using this package and get an error message, please open an issue!

Other things to do:

- Proper documentation, especially examples and vignettes
- Testing - need to read up on testing things that depend on HTTP requests
- Maybe release to CRAN someday?

## Inspiration

This package is heavily based on [csodata](https://github.com/CSOIreland/csodata), which wraps an identical API. I also learnt a lot from reading the code for [nomisr](https://github.com/ropensci/nomisr).
